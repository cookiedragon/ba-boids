  abstract =	"This paper presents solutions for one requirement of autonomous characters in animation and games: the ability to navigate around their world in a life-like and improvisational manner. These {"}steering behaviors{"} are largely independent of the particulars of the character's means of locomotion. Combinations of steering behaviors can be used to achieve higher level goals (For example: get from here to there while avoiding obstacles, follow this corridor, join that group of characters...) This paper divides motion behavior into three levels. It will focus on the middle level of steering behaviors, briefly describe the lower level of locomotion, and touch lightly on the higher level of goal setting and strategy.",

	abstract = {Models of self-propelled particles (SPPs) are an indispensable tool to investigate collective animal behaviour. Originally, SPP models were proposed with metric interactions, where each individual coordinates with neighbours within a fixed metric radius. However, recent experiments on bird flocks indicate that interactions are topological: each individual interacts with a fixed number of neighbours, irrespective of their distance. It has been argued that topological interactions are more robust than metric ones against external perturbations, a significant evolutionary advantage for systems under constant predatory pressure. Here, we test this hypothesis by comparing the stability of metric versus topological SPP models in three dimensions. We show that topological models are more stable than metric ones. We also show that a significantly better stability is achieved when neighbours are selected according to a spatially balanced topological rule, namely when interacting neighbours are evenly distributed in angle around the focal individual. Finally, we find that the minimal number of interacting neighbours needed to achieve fully stable cohesion in a spatially balanced model is compatible with the value observed in field experiments on starling flocks.},

In this paper, we present a GPU based implementation of Reynolds [1987] algorithm for simulating flocks of birds and propose an extension to consider environment self occlusion. We performed several experiments and the results showed that the proposed approach runs up to three times faster than the original algorithm when simulating high density crowds, without compromising significantly the original crowd behavior.

  abstract =	"The detection and analysis of clusters has become commonplace within geographic information science and has been applied in epidemiology, crime prevention, ecology, demography and other fields. One of the many methods for detecting and analyzing these clusters involves searching the dataset with a flock of boids (bird objects). While boids are effective at searching the dataset once their behaviors are properly configured, it can be difficult to find the proper configuration. Since genetic algorithms have been successfully used to configure neural networks, they may also be useful for configuring parameters guiding boid behaviors. In this paper, we develop a genetic algorithm to evolve the ideal boid behaviors.",
